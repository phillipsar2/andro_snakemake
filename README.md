# Population genetics of  Andropogon gerardii

A snakemake workflow for all things analysis

## Alignment Stats
Induviduals were aligned to a subset of 1200 contigs, composing 11% of the original JGI 
big bluestem genome, using BWA mem. 

-Mean of induvidual's average coverage = 160X
	35.33X coverage per subgenome
-Mean SD of each induvidual's coverage = 279.5
-Expected coverage based on the subset of contigs = 10-53X per induvidual
